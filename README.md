## Core Features

- **Process Management**: Scheduling algorithms, synchronization, deadlock detection
- **Memory Management**: Allocation strategies, virtual memory, paging
- **File Systems**: Allocation methods, directory structures, disk scheduling
- **I/O Management**: Device simulation, interrupt handling, buffering

## Development Phases

- [x] Phase 0: Project setup and planning
- [x] Phase 1: Foundation (2-3 weeks)
- [x] Phase 2: Core Modules (4-5 weeks)
