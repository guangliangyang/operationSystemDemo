# Development Workflow

## Step-by-Step Development Process

This project follows a structured development approach where each phase is completed and verified before proceeding to the next.

## Workflow Steps

1. **Plan & Design**: Each feature is planned and documented
2. **Implement**: Code the feature incrementally
3. **Test**: Verify functionality with unit tests
4. **Verify**: Manual testing and validation
5. **Commit**: Git commit with descriptive message
6. **Push**: Push to GitHub repository

## Verification Checklist

Before marking any phase as complete:

- [ ] Code compiles/runs without errors
- [ ] Unit tests pass (if applicable)
- [ ] Manual testing completed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code committed to git
- [ ] Changes pushed to GitHub

## Phase Development Order

### Phase 1: Foundation
1. Set up React frontend structure
2. Configure Node.js backend
3. Implement basic routing
4. Create common UI components

### Phase 2: Core Modules
1. Process scheduler simulator
2. Memory management visualizer
3. Basic file system operations
4. Integration testing

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. Synchronization primitives
2. Deadlock detection algorithms
3. I/O scheduling
4. Performance metrics

### Phase 4: Polish & Documentation
1. UI/UX improvements
2. Comprehensive documentation
3. Educational materials
4. Final testing

## Git Workflow

- Main branch: `main`
- Feature branches: `feature/phase-{number}-{description}`
- Commit format: `feat: description` or `fix: description`
- Tag releases: `v1.0.0` for major milestones

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for algorithms
- Integration tests for modules
- Manual testing for UI components
- Performance testing for simulations
